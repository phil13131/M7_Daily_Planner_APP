## description

***
 This is an application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day and helps to manage time effectively. It is featuring a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code - and developed over a starter code. This work focuses on utilizing Moment.js to enable the application to utilize date and time.<br>
<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:<br>
* WHEN I open the planner; THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
* WHEN I scroll down; THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours<br>
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day; THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
* WHEN I click into a timeblock; THEN I can enter an event<br>
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock; THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
* WHEN I refresh the page; THEN the saved events persist<br>
